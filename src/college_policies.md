### Academic Integrity  

As an academic community devoted to the life of the mind, Middlebury requires of every student complete intellectual honesty in the preparation and submission of all academic work. Details of our Academic Honesty, Honor Code, and Related Disciplinary Policies are available in [Middleburyâ€™s handbook](https://www.middlebury.edu/handbook/pages/ii-ug-college-policies/ug-policies/academics/acad-honesty/).

### Honor Code Pledge

The Honor Code pledge reads as follows: "I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this assignment." Please adhere to it and sign the Honor Code pledge on all problem sets.  

### Accommodations

Students who have Letters of Accommodation in this class are encouraged to contact me as early in the semester as possible to ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion. For those without Letters of Accommodation, assistance is available to eligible students through the Disability Resource Center. Please contact ADA Coordinators Jodi Litchfield and Peter Ploegman in the DRC at ada@middlebury.edu for more information. All discussions will remain confidential.
