The schedule below outlines dates, topics, objectives, and applications (or case studies that we will investigate). Most weeks follow a three-part sequence:  

1. introduce concepts,    
2. practice applying the concepts with Google Earth Engine,
3. discuss results and complete review problems.  

We break from this pattern three times over the semester when you work on problems independently. These dates are <mark>highlighted</mark> on the schedule.

_Please note: I will update this calendar regularly with links to materials for each meeting._
