Most weeks follow a three-part sequence: introduce concepts, practice applying the concepts with Google Earth Engine, discuss results and complete review problems. We break from this pattern three times over the semester when you work on problems independently. These dates are highlighted on the schedule. Please note: I will update this calendar regularly with links to materials for each meeting. DATE TOPICS OBJECTIVES APPLICATIONS PART 1.

Details of our Academic Honesty, Honor Code, and Related Disciplinary Policies are available in Middlebury\u2019s handbook . Honor Code Pledge The Honor Code pledge reads as follows: \u201cI have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this assignment.\u201d Please adhere to it and sign the Honor Code pledge on all problem sets. Accommodations Students who have Letters of Accommodation in this class are encouraged to contact me as early in the semester as possible to ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion. For those without Letters of Accommodation, assistance is available to eligible students through the Disability Resource Center. Please contact ADA Coordinators Jodi Litchfield and Peter Ploegman in the DRC at ada@middlebury.edu for more information.

How do geographers use this information to interpret changes in the global environment across space and time? In this course we will learn how to work with large geographic datasets to explore patterns and changes to the Earth\u2019s surface at local to global scales. Case studies will use remotely-sensed images to study land cover, climate, weather, wildfire, and other topics. Students will learn concepts, methods, and ethics for using a cloud-based geospatial analysis platform to process data, critically interpret workflows and results, and communicate findings with web maps and graphics. There is no required textbook for this course and the readings that I ask you to do will be accessible online. The majority (if not entirety) of readings are short and drawn from the Earth Observatory collection. The course is largely problem-based, where you learn by doing. I assume no previous experience with writing code or interpreting geographic images. I tend to introduce concepts through illustrations and activities before showing you how to implement the concepts by writing code. You will have many opportunities to practice applying the methods with support from peers and instructors before tackling the three independent problem (IP) sets, which function like exams in this course. Throughout the course, we use Google Earth Engine , a cloud-based geographic information system that is free to use (for education and environmental applications). With a web browser and an internet connection, you should be able to use your personal laptop for all the problems in this course.","title":"Description"},{"location":"evaluation/","text":"Your final grade will be based on weekly practice problems and independent problem sets (IP) .

They will consist of short problems and related questions. You may work on these in small groups (3 people maximum) or on your own if you prefer. You may also ask for clarity from an instructor at any point. You will be required to submit your work at the end of our Wednesday meeting. If you have worked through the entire meeting and want additional time, you will be granted permission for additional time as long as you ask and promise to submit your work before our Thursday meeting. On Thursday, we will discuss the practice problems. If time permits, we will also work through additional practice problems. Your grade for practice problems will be based on the answers that you submit prior to our Thursday meeting and your participation in both meetings.

You are not authorized to discuss the problems with peers. You may refer to your own notes and your previous work in the course, and you may ask the professor for clarity, but you may not discuss the problems with anyone else. Collaborative After the class meeting, you will have additional time to finish solving the problems and correcting any mistakes in your first submission. Your final solutions are due the first Friday by 5pm. You are authorized and encouraged to talk with instructors or peers in the class. Each problem in the set will be graded based on your ability to work out solutions independently or with assistance: GRADE POINTS SOLUTION A 4 Complete and correct solution by end of independent phase. B 3 One or more correct parts of a solution that contains one or more errors by end of independent phase. Complete and correct solution by end of collaborative phase. C 2 No correct parts of the solution by end of independent phase, but all parts correct and complete by end of collaborative phase. Or some incorrect parts of the solution by end of independent phase and failure to correct all parts by end of collaborative phase. F 0 Failure to submit solution by end of collaborative phase without discussing extra time with the professor. Letter grades will be the average of the three scores.

You also pledge to not distribute or share any part of the problem set repositories, or any part of the scripts that you develop while solving the problems in the set, with other students outside of the present class at any time. This will allow me to recycle these problems in the future without disadvantaging students in the present. Thank you. Independent phase You will have the class meeting time to independently solve and submit solutions to the problem(s). You must submit separate links to each script in the problem set dropbox (this will be demonstrated at the beginning of the problem set). We will start the clock after we have read through the problems together and I have answered any questions. While you work on a problem set, you are authorized to refer to the eePrimer repository, the scripts that you have written previously in this class, and your notes from lecture meetings. Otherwise, during the independent phase, you are not authorized to communicate in any way with anyone about the problem set. Collaborative phase You are responsible for solving all three problems and meeting all prompt criteria by the end of the collaborative phase as marked on the syllabus calendar. You must submit revised scripts in the problem set dropbox. Please note: you do not need to re-submit a link to a solution if you solved it correctly in the independent phase. During the collaborative phase, you are authorized and encouraged to talk to instructors and other students in the course about the problems. We will discuss the solutions as a class in our lecture meeting on Wednesday. During the collaborative phase, you may work on problems with peers in this class. You may also discuss any part of any problem with Jeff Howarth or the ASI in our office hours.","title":"Problem sets"}]}
