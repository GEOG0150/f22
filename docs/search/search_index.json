Please contact ADA Coordinators Jodi Litchfield and Peter Ploegman in the DRC at ada@middlebury.edu for more information. All discussions will remain confidential. Academic Integrity As an academic community devoted to the life of the mind, Middlebury requires of every student complete intellectual honesty in the preparation and submission of all academic work. Details of our Academic Honesty, Honor Code, and Related Disciplinary Policies are available in Middlebury\u2019s handbook . Honor Code Pledge The Honor Code pledge reads as follows: \u201cI have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this assignment.\u201d Please adhere to it and sign the Honor Code pledge on all problem sets.","title":"College"},{"location":"description/","text":"How do geographers use geospatial technologies to observe the Earth\u2019s surface? How do geographers use this information to interpret changes in the global environment across space and time? In this course we will learn how to work with large geographic datasets to explore patterns and changes to the Earth\u2019s surface at local to global scales. Case studies will use remotely-sensed images to study land cover, climate, weather, wildfire, and other topics. Students will learn concepts, methods, and ethics for using a cloud-based geospatial analysis platform to process data, critically interpret workflows and results, and communicate findings with web maps and graphics. As a textbook, we will mostly use A primer for Earth Engine , an open-source textbook that I am writing. The additional readings that I ask you to do will also be accessible online. The majority (if not entirety) of readings are short and drawn from the Earth Observatory collection. The course is largely problem-based, where you learn by doing. I assume no previous experience with writing code or interpreting geographic images. I tend to introduce concepts through illustrations and activities before showing you how to implement the concepts by writing code. You will have many opportunities to practice applying the methods with support from peers and instructors before tackling the three independent problem (IP) sets, which function like exams in this course. Throughout the course, we use Google Earth Engine , a cloud-based geographic information system that is free to use (for education and environmental applications). With a web browser and an internet connection, you should be able to use your personal laptop for all the problems in this course.","title":"Description"},{"location":"evaluation/","text":"Your final grade will be based on weekly practice problems and independent problem sets (IP) .

You also pledge to not distribute or share any part of this repository, or any part of the scripts that you develop while solving these problems, with other students outside of the present class at any time, so that I can re-use these problems in the future without disadvantaging students in the present. Thank you. Get organized Please get organized. Create a new folder in your earth engine GG150 repository called IP , or something roughly equivalent. For each problem, you must create a separate script in this folder. In other words, over the two-day IP you will write three separate javaScript files , one for each problem solution. Tuesday you receive one problem; Wednesday you receive two more. Please save your work regularly . EE uses git, so saving is a commit, which facilitates versioning, which is a helpful way of documenting workflows. When you are ready to submit your solutions, you will copy and paste url links for each script into a google form. The next section describes how that works. Dropbox Please open this DROPBOX . In the appropriate places, please write your email address, the honor code, and your name. When you have finished a problem, please copy and paste a url to the script in the form for the problem. Please note: the form contains places to paste a link to all three problems. On Tue, please submit the form with the solution for Problem 1 and leave the answers for Problems 2 and 3 blank. On Wed, please submit the form with solutions for Problem 2 and 3 and leave the answers for Problem 1 blank. How to generate a link to your script You should be familiar with this routine by now from our practice problems. When you have finished a problem: Save the script. Then click the Get Link button at the top of the Code Editor panel. This will generate a url to your script. The url is shown in the pop-up panel. It is also shown in the address bar of your browser. Please copy the url and then paste it into the appropriate section of the form. Before the clock runs out please click the Submit button. You will automatically receive a copy of your submission to the email account that you provided. Please note that the Get Link url creates a snapshot of your script. If you make any changes to your code after creating the url, I will not be able to see them. I only see the state of your script when you click the Get Link button. This means that you can continue to work on the script after submitting your first solutions and do not need to create new javaScript files to work on the next phase. Problems Links will become available during first and second phases.

You will be introduced to a set of tools and your goal will be to figure out how to solve the problem with the tools that you are learning how to use. You may work on these in small groups (opposites and triangles preferred, rectangles maximum) or on your own if you prefer. You may also ask for clarity from an instructor at any point. You will be required to submit your work at the end of our Wednesday meeting. If you have worked through the entire meeting and want additional time, you will be granted permission for additional time as long as you ask and promise to submit your work before our Thursday meeting. On Thursday, we will discuss the practice problems. If time permits, we will also work through additional problems. You will then have until FRIDAY 5pm to submit a solution without errors to the dropbox. Your grade for practice problems will be based on participation (you submitted progress at the end of lab meeting) and submission of agreed upon solution by FRIDAY 5pm . Absences or late work will be penalized one grade step per infraction (A becomes A, A- becomes B+).","title":"Practice problems"},{"location":"problemSets/","text":"Each independent problem (IP) set will consist of an independent and a collaborative phase: PHASE RULES Independent You will have class time to independently work out solutions to 1 (Tuesday meeting ) or 2 problems (Wednesday meeting). You are not authorized to discuss the problems with peers. You may refer to your own notes and your previous work in the course, and you may ask the professor for clarity, but you may not discuss the problems with anyone else. Collaborative After the class meeting, you will have additional time to finish solving the problems and correcting any mistakes in your first submission. Your final solutions are due the first Friday by 5pm. You are authorized and encouraged to talk with instructors or peers in the class. Each problem in the set will be graded based on your ability to work out solutions independently or with assistance: GRADE POINTS SOLUTION A 4 Complete and correct solution by end of independent phase. B 3 One or more correct parts of a solution that contains one or more errors by end of independent phase. Complete and correct solution by end of collaborative phase. C 2 No correct parts of the solution by end of independent phase, but all parts correct and complete by end of collaborative phase. Or some incorrect parts of the solution by end of independent phase and failure to correct all parts by end of collaborative phase. F 0 Failure to submit solution by end of collaborative phase without discussing extra time with the professor. Letter grades will be the average of the three scores.

Independent phase You will have the class meeting time to independently solve and submit solutions to the problem(s). You must submit separate links to each script in the problem set dropbox (this will be demonstrated at the beginning of the problem set). We will start the clock after we have read through the problems together and I have answered any questions. While you work on a problem set, you are authorized to refer to the eePrimer repository, the scripts that you have written previously in this class, and your notes from lecture meetings. Otherwise, during the independent phase, you are not authorized to communicate in any way with anyone about the problem set. Collaborative phase You are responsible for solving all three problems and meeting all prompt criteria by the end of the collaborative phase as marked on the syllabus calendar. You must submit revised scripts in the problem set dropbox. Please note: you do not need to re-submit a link to a solution if you solved it correctly in the independent phase. During the collaborative phase, you are authorized and encouraged to talk to instructors and other students in the course about the problems. We will discuss the solutions as a class in our lecture meeting on Wednesday. During the collaborative phase, you may work on problems with peers in this class. You may also discuss any part of any problem with Jeff Howarth or the ASI in our office hours.","title":"Problem sets"}]}
